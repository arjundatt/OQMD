<h2>Abstract</h2>
Migrating large volumes of data from one database storage platform to another is a common problem which is required to be managed to provide the acceptable performance. We elucidate OQMD - a common query interface to access data from heterogeneous set of databases. The tool comprises of a Schema Unification Engine which takes care of mapping all attributes from one database to another; and a Common Query Engine which parses an ``SQL-like'' query and provides access to similar data in different databases. This tool reduces the effort required to search multiple databases with different data mechanics, using a generic approach. The proposed model can be very a helpful and powerful alternative to the time consuming process of ETL(Extract, Transform and Load).
